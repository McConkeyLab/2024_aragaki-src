    Past work in preclinical models of solid tumors have implicated SRC in invasion and metastasis, but also demonstrated it inhibited bladder cancer metastasis. Here we tested the hypothesis that the role of SRC in metastasis is dependent on bladder cancer molecular subtype membership. Analyses of large public datasets demonstrated that SRC mRNA and protein expression are enriched in tumors assigned to the luminal papillary molecular subtype. Using the consensus classifier on RNA expression from 30 cell lines, we demonstrated that chemical SRC antagonists inhibited migration in luminal papillary cells but had little effect in basal/squamous lines. Conditional SRC knockdown inhibited migration in luminal papillary RT112 cells, whereas it increased migration and reduced proliferation in luminal papillary UM-UC6 cells. Regardless, these effects did not affect levels or sites of experimental metastasis _in vivo_. Overall, the results support the conclusion that SRC's biological effects in bladder cancer are not primarily involved in promoting invasion and metastasis. Further work is required to define SRC's roles in luminal papillary bladder cancers.

= INTRODUCTION
The SRC protooncogene was first identified as the causative factor that mediated the transforming effects of an avian leukemia virus @Rous_1911. Its human counterpart encodes a 60kD non-receptor tyrosine kinase@Martin_2004 that has been implicated in cell cycle progression and integrin-mediated adhesion signaling. Early studies in hematopoietic cells and solid tumor cell lines implicated the integrin-dependent effects of SRC in directional motility, invasion, and metastasis @Yeatman_2004. However, studies in preclinical models of bladder cancer concluded that SRC inhibited invasion and metastasis via mechanisms that involved direct phosphorylation of RhoGDI2 and downstream inhibition of caveolin-1 @Thomas_2011 @Wu_2009.

Bladder cancers are highly heterogeneous in their invasive and metastatic potentials. The majority of bladder cancers are superficial low-grade papillary lesions (non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer, NMIBC) that are prone to recurrence but rarely progress to become life-threatening and metastatic. However, approximately 20-25% of bladder cancers are muscle-invasive at diagnosis, and about half of patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) ultimately die of metastatic disease@Kamat_2016. MIBC can also be grouped into basal and luminal molecular subtypes that are similar to those described in breast cancer@Robertson_2017 @Damrauer_2014 @Choi_2014. Luminal bladder cancers are enriched with activating FGFR3 mutations and fusions@Knowles_2014 @Cappellen_1999, higher expression of differentiation markers, and better survival outcomes@Robertson_2017, whereas basal bladder cancers exhibit features of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and are associated with invasive and metastatic disease at clinical presentation and shorter disease-specific survival @Kamat_2016 @Robertson_2017. We hypothesized that SRC plays different roles in luminal versus basal bladder cancers. We tested this hypothesis using public human bladder cancer bulk RNA expression datasets, human bladder cancer cell lines, and _in vivo_ metastasis models.

== SRC expression across subtypes
We first used public bulk mRNA expression datasets to explore if SRC expression correlated with stage and molecular subtype membership. Consistent with previous findings @Fanning_1992, SRC expression was significantly higher in NMIBC relative to MIBC (@fig1, A). SRC levels were relatively high in the least aggressive UROMOL subtype (Class 1), but also in the subtype associated with the highest rate of progression (Class 2a) (@fig1, B) @Lindskrog_2021. However, SRC expression strongly correlated with progression score in Class 1 but not Class 2a tumors, (@fig1, C), implying SRC expression may play an indirect role in muscle invasion by potentiating progression.

Analyses of MIBCs revealed similar patterns between subtype aggressiveness and SRC expression, with SRC RNA (@fig2, A) and protein expression (@fig2, B) enriched in luminal papillary and luminal subtypes versus the others, and total and active site phosphorylated (Y416) SRC protein levels were also selectively enriched in the least luminal-papillary TCGA subtype.

) <fig2>


== Differential SRC expression in human cell lines
We next examined whether SRC expression was also heterogeneous in a panel of 30 human bladder cancer cell lines. To compare to human tumors, we first classified the cells by consensus class@Kamoun_2020. We found that our luminal-papillary (LP) cell lines expressed significantly higher levels of SRC than the basal squamous (BS) lines (@fig3, A), consistent with our findings in human tumors. On the other hand, using GSVA to calculate gene set enrichment scores across classes, we found that the EMT signature was significantly upregulated in the BS lines when compared to the LP lines (@fig3, B).

) <fig3>


== Differential cell line motility across consensus class

To see if enrichment of EMT score correlated with motility, we performed two--dimensional migration assays using uncoated transwells, and invasion assays using Matrigel coated transwells using cells from  within each class. We noted that LP lines tended to migrate (@fig4, C) and invade (@fig4, D) less readily than BS lines, but the differences were not statistically significant. However, we did note a statistically significant correlation between EMT score and both migration (@fig4, A) and invasion (@fig4, B).

) <fig4>

== Differential sensitivity to SRC across consensus class
We next determined if sensitivity to Src inhibition varied across consensus classes using migration assays. We exposed representative LP and BS lines to the Src inhibitor bosutinib. On average, LP lines migrated at 53% their original rate, while BS lines migrated 72% their average rate; However, neither of these changes were statistically significant (@fig5).

#figure(
    grid(
        image("02_figures/cells-mig-bos.svg")
    ),
    caption: [*Sensitivity to Src inhibition across consensus subtypes.* Changes in migration rates across consensus subtypes without (DMSO, -) or with (+) 1Î¼M bositinib. LP: Luminal papillary; BS: Basal squamous]
) <fig5>


Chemical inhibitors can have off-target effects. Although we selected bosutinib based on its selectivity@Klaeger_2017, we wondered whether the effects of bosutinib in the sensitive cell lines might be due to off--target effects. As an initial attempt to address this possibility, we examined the effects of the chemically-distinct inhibitor, saracatinib (AZD0530). Although bosutinib had no effect, saracatinib strongly inhibited migration in both RT112 and UM-UC6 (@figs1). Because saracatinib also inhibits the TGF-Î² receptor@Klaeger_2017, we tested the effects of galunisertib, a TGF-Î² receptor I inhibitor. Galunisertib had no effect on migration in RT112 but did appear to reduce rates consistently (but not significantly) in UC6 (@figs1). Galunisertibe did not inhibit migration in RT112 (@figs1).

    caption: [*UC6 migration may be mediated by TGFb rather than Src.* Migration rates of cells exposed to DMSO (-) or 1Î¼M bosutinib, 1Î¼M galunisertib, 1Î¼M galunisertib + 1Î¼M bosutinib, or 1Î¼M saracatinib (+).]
) <figs1>


We generated doxycycline-inducible SRC knockdown (SRC iKD) lines and performed migration assays with and without 48h 1Î¼g/mL doxycycline pre-incubation. Similar to small molecule inhibitors, RT112 demonstrated an insignificant reduction in migration upon SRC KD, while UC6 showed a modest increase in migration upon SRC KD (@fig6).

        columns: (0.8fr, 1fr),

    caption: [*Src knockdown has differential effects on migration across cell lines.* Migration rates of doxycycline-inducible SRC knockdown cell lines both without (-) and with (+) 48hr 1Î¼g/mL doxycycline pre-incubation.]
) <fig6>


Because Src can also be required for proliferation@Thomas_1997, we also measured the effects of SRK KD on proliferation upon in two cell lines. Bosutinib inhibited proliferation in both cell lines, whereas SRC knockdown only inhibited proliferation in UC6 lines (@figs3).

) <figs3>


== _in vivo_ effects of SRC inhibition
Finally, to directly examine the effects of SRC inhibition on metastasis, we pre-incubated the RT112 and UM-UC6 iKD cells +/- doxycycline before inoculating them into the tail veins of immunodeficient NSG mice housed with or without doxycycline in their drinking water. RT112 produced metastases in the lungs, liver, and spine, resulting in failure to void and hind leg paralysis, whereas UM-UC6 caused lymph node and lung metastases. SRC knockdown extended survival in mice inoculated with UM-UC6 but had no effect in animals with RT112 metastases (@fig7) and did not affect the sites of metastasis in either model.

= DISCUSSION
Src was one of the first discovered proto-oncogenes @Martin_2004, and over 100 years of study have revealed it serves a complex and varied role in cancer@Thomas_1997. In this study, we sought to clarify the paradoxical role of Src as a metastasis suppressor in bladder cancer by testing the hypothesis that its effects may be dependent on molecular subtype. Overall, we observed modest and inconsistent effects of chemical SRC inhibitors or conditional SRC knockdown in conventional two-dimensional invasion and migration assays, and SRC knockdown also had modest effects in a model of experimental metastasis. SRC did appear to be required for proliferation in UC6 cells, which may explain why knockdown extended survival in the UC6 metastasis model. It is possible that established human cell lines and two-dimensional tissue culture are not adequate models of primary human tumors. In the future, we plan to address this possibility using three-dimensional invasion assays and patient derived organoid models.

On the other hand, our results reinforce the original conclusion, that SRC is enriched in luminal papillary human primary tumors. The luminal papillary subtype is associated with earlier state disease and better prognoses than are tumors belonging to the other molecular subtypes. In particular, luminal papillary tumors are characterized by gene expression signatures associated with terminal differentiation, suggesting that SRC may play an important role in this process. We also plan to directly test this possibility in appropriate preclinical models in future studies.

    == Chemicals and reagents
Saracatinib (Selleck, S1006), bosutinib (Selleck, S1014), and galunisertib (MedChemExpress, HY-13226) were dissolved in DMSO at stock concentrations of 10mM and stored at -80\u{00B0}C. Prior to use, each inhibitor was diluted in culture medium yielding a maximum DMSO concentration of 1%.

    == Cell culture
All parental cell lines were obtained from the Pathology Core of the Bladder Cancer SPORE at MD Anderson Cancer Center, with the exceptions of T24 and SCaBER where were purchased from the American Type Culture Collections. Cells were cultured as monolayers with Minimum Essential Medium (Gibco, 11095080) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Corning, 35-011-CV), 1% nonessential amino acids (Gibco, 11140050), 1% vitamin solution (Gibco, 11120052), 1% penicillin-streptomycin solution (Gibco, 15140122), and 1% sodium pyruvate (Gibco, 11360070). Cells were incubated 37\u{00B0}C in a humidified, 5% CO#sub[2] atmosphere. Cell line identity confirmed by DNA fingerprinting through the MD Anderson Characterized Cell Line Core and the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine Genetic Resources Core Facility.

    == Generation of conditional knockdown cell lines
    Conditional knockdown lines were generated using SMARTvector Inducible Lentiviral shRNAs (Horizon Discovery). Lines were transduced either with lentivirus with constructs containing shRNA designed to target SRC (V3IHSPGG_10847004) or a non-targeting control (VSC6580) with a PGK RNA Pol II promoter. UM-UC6 was seeded at 10,000 cells/mL and RT112 at 30,000 cells/mL. Transduction was performed without serum, and transduced cells selected with 2.5Î¼g/mL puromycin (InvivoGen, ant-pr-1).

    == Transwell migration and invasion assays
Subconfluent cells were trypsinized, resuspended in serum containing medium, centrifuged, washed with PBS, centrifuged, and resupsended in serum free medium. 30,000 to 60,000 cells were then seeded into the upper chamber of the transwell in 0.5ml of serum free medium. The lower chamber was loaded with 30% FBS-containing medium to establish a chemo-attractant gradient. Migration or invasion was allowed to proceed for 4 to 20 hours. Membranes were then fixed, uninvaded cells wiped away, and remaining cells stained with gentian violet or DAPI. The entire filter was imaged by light microscopy and invaded cells quantified with CellProfiler@Stirling_2021. 8Âµm pore Matrigel coated transwells (Corning, 354480) and uncoated transwells (Corning, 354578) were purchased from Corning. Collagen-1 coated transwells were generated by applying 0.2mg/ml collagen-1 (Corning 354236) in PBS to uncoated transwell filters overnight. Collagen-1 filters were rinsed with PBS and used immediately or stored at 4\u{00B0}C for up to one week.

    == Western blotting
    Subconfluent cells were harvested in RIPA buffer containing protease (cOmplete, Roche 11836153001) and phosphatase (PhosSTOP, Roche, 4906837001) inhibitors. Following protein quantification by BCA assay (Thermo Scientific, 23235), samples were diluted and boiled in 2x 2-mercaptoethanol containing Laemmli sample buffer (BioRad, 1610737). SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis was run at 100 volts for 1.5 hours in Tris-Glycine-SDS buffer (BioRad, 1610732), followed by transfer onto nitrocellulose membrane in Tris-Glycine buffer (BioRad, 1610734) with 20% methanol for 2 hours at 100 volts. Membranes were blocked in casein blocking buffer (Sigma-Aldrich, B6429) for 1 hour, then incubated for 2 hours or overnight in primary antibody (1:1000 or 1:5000 dilution, 0.1X casein), washed in TBS-T (1X TBS, BioRad, 1706435; 0.1% Tween 20, Sigma-Aldrich, P7949), and incubated in secondary antibody for 1 hour (1:5000 dilution, 0.1X casein). In instances where multiple proteins of similar molecular weight were probed, identical but separate blot were performed at the same time. Loading control (actin) was examined on previously probed blots. Primary antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling including Src, (#2123, RRID:AB_2106047, diluted 1:1000), Smad2 (#3122, RRID:AB_823638, diluted 1:1000), and pS465/468 Smad2 (#3108 RRID:AB_490941, diluted 1:1000). Additional primary antibodies were purchased from ThermoFisher including FAK (AHO0502, RRID:AB_2536313, diluted 1:1000) and pY861 FAK (#44-626G, RRID:AB_2533703, diluted 1:1000) or Sigma-Aldrich including actin (A2066, RRID:AB_476693, diluted 1:5000). Secondary antibodies were purchased from LI-COR (LI-COR 926-32210, 926-32211, diluted 1:5000).

    == Tail Vein Injection
    NSG mice were warmed in a mouse restrainer using a heat lamp to facilitate vasodilation. The tail was sterilized with 70% ethanol. A 100 ÂµL cell suspension in PBS, containing 2Ã10^6 UM-UC6 cells or 5Ã10^5 RT112 cells, was slowly injected into the tail vein after confirming blood backflow.

    == Lung Metastasis Quantification
    All physical H&E slides were scanned using the CONCENTRIQ platform for metastasis quantification. The tumor fraction in the lungs was quantified by calculating the ratio of the total metastatic area to the total lung area using FIJI@Schindelin_2012.

    == Statistical Analyses
    All analyses were performed using R@R (v. 4.4.1). P \< 0.05 was used as a cutoff for statistical significance. T-tests are two-tailed. Paired t-tests were used to compare drug/control within biological replicates. Log-rank test was used to test for survival differences (`survival`@survival-package). `GSVA`@GSVA was used to calculate signature enrichment scores.

    == Data Availability
    The Lund cohort data were obtained from GEO (GSE32894). The UROMOL cohort were obtained from the supplementary data from the original paper @Lindskrog_2021. TCGA BLCA data were obtained from the Genomic Data Commons, using the pipeline provided at https://github.com/McConkeyLab/general_tcga.
