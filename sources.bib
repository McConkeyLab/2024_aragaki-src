  Abstract        = {The results presented in this report demonstrate that the tyrosine-specific protein kinase activity of pp60c-src is
                  elevated over that recorded in normal bladder mucosa in a
                  subset of human bladder carcinomas. Increased kinase activity
                  was observed mainly in low grade bladder lesions and was
                  associated, at least in part, with elevated levels of
                  pp60c-src expression. Extension of this analysis to a panel of
                  human bladder carcinoma cell lines confirmed previous
                  observations of low pp60c-src kinase activity in three lines
                  established from high grade (GIII) bladder tumors and revealed
                  increased kinase activity in three alternative bladder lines
                  derived from GI or GII tumors. Use of an anti-phosphotyrosine
                  antibody in Western blot analysis revealed the presence of
                  novel phosphotyrosyl cellular substrates in human bladder cell
                  lines and tumors displaying elevated pp60c-src kinase
                  activity. These observations suggest an association for the
                  src protooncogene in urothelial cell differentiation events.}, URL             = {http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/1371716}
